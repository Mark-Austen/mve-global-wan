This example deploys Megaport Virtual Edge (MVE) in 10 global locations and a full mesh private network between all locations using Megaports private backbone. In this scenario, the MVEs would provide regional aggregation for Internet based SD-WAN sites within the region. The following resources are deployed:

* 2 x Megaport Virtual Edge with the Cisco C8Kv in the following locations:
  * Sydney (8vCPU)
  * Singapore (8vCPU)
  * Hong Kong (4vCPU)
  * Frankfurt (4vCPU)
  * Dallas (4vCPU)
* 1Gbps Internet Transit connected to each MVE
* 2 x 1Gbps Private VXC between all locations
